                    Russian traders and soldiers began to appear on the northwestern edge of Kazakh 
                    territory in the 17th century, when Cossacks established the forts that later became 
                    the cities of Oral (Ural'sk) and Atyrau (Gur'yev). Russians were able to seize Kazakh 
                    territory because the khanates were preoccupied by Kalmyks (Oirats, Dzungars), who in 
                    the late 16th century had begun to move into Kazakh territory from the east. Forced 
                    westward in what they call their Great Retreat, the Kazakhs were increasingly caught 
                    between the Kalmyks and the Russians. Two of the Kazakh Jüzes were dependant on Oirat Huntaiji.

                    In 1730 Abul Khayr, one of the khans of the Junior Jüz, sought Russian assistance. Although 
                    Abul Khayr's intent had been to form a temporary alliance against the stronger Kalmyks, the 
                    Russians gained permanent control of the Junior Jüz as a result of his decision. Shortly 
                    thereafter the Middle Jüz's Khan Semeke agreed to suzerainty under the same terms. Neither 
                    khan remained very loyal to the Russians, but from this point Russian sovereigns began to 
                    assert the right to appoint the khans of the Junior and Middle Jüzes and to exert greater 
                    influence on them. The Kazakhs in turn began to view the khanate with greater suspicion, as 
                    khans increasingly sought Russian help against their rivals within the Khanate. Although 
                    the Khanate recovered a degree of independence under Ablai from 1750-1778, his son failed to 
                    unite even the Middle Jüz, and in 1798, the Russians attempted direct rule over the Middle 
                    Jüz, establishing a tribunal at Petropavlovsk. In 1824, the Russians abolished the 
                    khanate of the Middle Jüz. The Senior Jüz managed to remain independent until the 1820s, 
                    when the expanding Kokand Khanate to the south forced the Senior Jüz khans to choose Russian 
                    protection, which seemed to be the lesser of two evils.

                    The conquest of Kazakhstan by Russia was slowed by numerous uprisings and wars in the 19th 
                    century. For example, uprisings of Isatay Taymanuly and Makhambet Utemisuly in 1836–1838 and 
                    the war led by Eset Kotibaruli in 1847–1858 were some of such events of anti-colonial resistance.

                    In 1863 Russian Empire elaborated a new imperial policy, announced in the Gorchakov Circular, 
                    asserting the right to annex "troublesome" areas on the empire's borders. This policy led 
                    immediately to the Russian conquest of the rest of Central Asia and the creation of two 
                    administrative districts, the General-Gubernatorstvo (Governor-Generalship) of Russian Turkestan 
                    and that of the Steppe. Most of present-day Kazakhstan was in the Steppe District, and parts of 
                    present-day southern Kazakhstan, including Almaty (Verny), were in the Governor-Generalship.
